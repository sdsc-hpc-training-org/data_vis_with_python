<p>Python is rapidly becoming the programming language of choice for scientific research, and Jupyter Notebooks provide a user-friendly way of writing and running python code and of teaching and learning how to program. Visual analytics is playing an increasingly important role in data science by allowing researchers to explore massive amounts of data for patterns which may not be obvious using other methods.</p>

In this webinar, we will briefly review data visualization principles and practices and jump into a series of data visualization examples using Python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, bokeh, seaborn, and networkx.

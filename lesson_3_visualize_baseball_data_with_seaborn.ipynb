Recall that the index of a dataframe is the group of labels for each row.  In the raw dataframes that we created when we read in the csv files, the index was simply an incrementing set of integers over each of the rows.  When we execute a groupby operation such as those above, a new dataframe is returned, and the index of that dataframe is the set of labels that we grouped on, e.g., the yearID's in the first example and the playerID's in the second example.  Sometimes it is useful to keep the groupby key as the index, but sometimes you might want to put the key back in as a regular column, and use incrementing integers as an index instead.

#Lesson 1

##Interactive Visualization of Weather Time Series Data With Bokeh

In this lesson, we will do some simple plotting just using matplotlib to get an idea of what plotting is typically like in Python. Then we will add some pan/zoom interactivity to the plots using Bokeh. 

##About the data

This data was collected from the High-Performance Wireless Research and Education Network (HPWREN, <a href="https://hpwren.ucsd.edu">https://hpwren.ucsd.edu</a>). HPWREN has worked in coordination with San Diego Gas & Electric and regional wildfire first response services to establish the finest real-time weather data collection and video minitoring system on the planet.

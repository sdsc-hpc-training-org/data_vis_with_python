# Lesson 1

<h1>Interactive Visualization of Weather Time Series Data With Bokeh</h1>

In this lesson, we will do some simple plotting just using matplotlib to get an idea of what plotting is typically like in Python. Then we will add some pan/zoom interactivity to the plots using Bokeh. 

<h2>About the data</h2>

This data was collected from the High-Performance Wireless Research and Education Network (HPWREN, <a href="https://hpwren.ucsd.edu">https://hpwren.ucsd.edu</a>). HPWREN has worked in coordination with San Diego Gas & Electric and regional wildfire first response services to establish the finest real-time weather data collection and video minitoring system on the planet.

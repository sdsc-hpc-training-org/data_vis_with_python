<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

For these lessons you will need Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed. The best way to do this is with <b><a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">anaconda</a></b>. 

<h2>Required Libraries</h2>

You will also need the following libraries:

pandas, datetime, dateutil, ipywidgets, matplotlib, seaborn, networkx, bokeh

<h2>The Github Repo For These Lessons</h2>

The Jupyter Notebooks for these lessons can be downloaded here:

<a href="https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/data_vis_with_python">https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/data_vis_with_python</a>

<h2>Download Data For These Lessons</h2>

The data for these lessons is too large for the Github repo. You can download the data for these lessons here:

<a href="https://education.sdsc.edu/201912_data_viz_python_4webinar/data_vis_with_python_lesson_data.zip">https://education.sdsc.edu/201912_data_viz_python_4webinar/data_vis_with_python_lesson_data.zip</a>

Place the 'data' folder in the same folder with the .ipynb files. 

<h1>The Jupyter Project</h1>

“Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.”

<h1>The Python Visualization Landscape</h1>

There are many different applications to be found in the python visualization landscape. We will be covering only a small part of it in these lessons.

<h1>Bokeh</h1>
“Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. It serves as a web-based front end to matplotlib using JavaScript behind the scenes to run in a browser”. Learn more at <a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html" target="_new">https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html</a>.

<h1>Matplotlib</h1>

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib is the 'default' visualization application for Python. Learn more at <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">https://matplotlib.org/</a>.

<h1>Seaborn</h1>

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Learn more at <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">https://seaborn.pydata.org/</a>.

<h1>Networkx</h1>

NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. Learn more at <a href="https://networkx.github.io/">https://networkx.github.io/</a>.

<h1>HoloViz/HoloViews</h1>

HoloViz is a set of high-level tools to simplify visualization in Python, one of which is Bokeh. We will not be covering HoloViz in this tutorial but it is something to anticipate for future more advanced tutorials. Learn more at <a href="http://holoviz.org/">http://holoviz.org/</a>.

# Lesson 5

<h1>Create a Heatmap of Weather Data Using Seaborn</h1>

In this lesson we will use Seaborn to create a heatmap of one or more weather parameters such as temperature or humidity. The term 'heatmap' does not really have anything to do with heat, it's just a convenient way of referring to the plot method and the effect it creates.

<h2>About the data</h2>

This data was collected from the High-Performance Wireless Research and Education Network (HPWREN, <a href="https://hpwren.ucsd.edu">https://hpwren.ucsd.edu</a>). HPWREN has worked in coordination with San Diego Gas & Electric and regional wildfire first response services to establish the finest real-time weather data collection and video minitoring system on the planet.

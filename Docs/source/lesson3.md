# Lesson 3

<h2>Digging around the Baseball Databank: Statistics Visualization With Seaborn</h2>

In this lesson we will explore a publicly available dataset, The Baseball Databank.

##About the data

<a href="https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank">The Baseball Databank</a>, along with other relevant open baseball datasets, are described and linked to here, with the current version contained in the baseballdatabank git repository. The easiest way to get the data on your machine locally is to clone or download the repository. Once you have downloaded the data, you will find it contains two folders, 'core' and 'upstream'. The 'core' folder contains the databank itself, and 'upstream' contains files used to construct the databank.

# Lesson 4

##Using Pandas, Bokeh, and Networkx to Visualize Twitter Social Network Graph

In this example, we show how Bokeh can work with Networkx graphs to add some useful interactivity. We will be using a dataset similar to the one used in the lesson on plotting Twitter data for the #muellereport, but it is much smaller.

##About the data

This dataset was created using the Twitter Streaming API searching for all tweets/retweets which use the hashtag 'climatechange'. The original data was collected in its native JSON format.  It was collected in late 2018 when the U.S. government released its annual report on climate change.
